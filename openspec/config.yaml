schema: minimalist

context: |
  Repository purpose: Package reusable OpenSpec schemas.
  Quality gate: After every implementation/apply that changes schemas, run
  `openspec schema review <schema-name>` for each affected schema before
  considering the work complete.

rules:
  specs:
    - If a change modifies files under `openspec/schemas/`, list each affected schema name explicitly.
    - Ensure requirements/scenarios include a post-apply verification expectation for schema review.
  tasks:
    - Add a required verification task: run `openspec schema review <schema-name>` for each affected schema.
    - Do not mark apply complete until all required schema review commands pass.
