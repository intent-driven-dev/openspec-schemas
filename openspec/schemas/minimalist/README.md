# Minimalist OpenSpec Schema

`minimalist` is for getting to build quickly with a direct `specs -> tasks` flow.

- Good fit: landing pages and simple apps with too many technical design decisions.
- Not a good fit: complete apps with multiple layers, database work, and broader architecture concerns.

## Install (copy/paste)

Use the root `README.md` single-line install command with:
- `SCHEMA="minimalist"`

## Activate

Set this in `openspec/config.yaml`:

```yaml
schema: minimalist
```
